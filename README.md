# Temperature app
## Database
The app is using my personal Firebase account for the backend, which already contains some test data. Although the instructions did not require to display the database on the frontend, I added the Database component to the app, which is currently commented out. You can un-comment it in the App component on line 78. Feel free to add some additional data.
